CK2Plus is a collaborative effort. While most of the work is done by me personally, it also includes parts of many other mods (see credits for full list). You are free to use any part of this mod in your own mods as long as you give due credit to the creator of said part.

************
* Features *
************
- More provinces and sea zones.
- Civil wars are more dangerous: A revolting vassal that is trying to depose you will ask all other vassals to join him, which can result in a major revolt among vassals that like him better than they like you.
- Better title distribution AI: The AI will no longer give all its Duke titles to a single ruler or put Duchies in oddly misplaced locations when a better option exists.
- Holy Wars cost piety to fight, so that the general rate of expansion in Iberia and the Middle East is slowed. Overseas Holy Wars cost a large amount of piety, and the AI will largely avoid fighting them. Crusades/Jihads are not affected.
- Balanced Anti-Popes that are not simply endless money machines.
- More lethal diseases and battles, making medieval life the violent and uncertain existance it should be.
- Many more Empires and Kingdoms to create.
- Rebalanced combat where the martial score of the generals is an important factor.
- More mercenaries and holy orders.
- More cultures.
- It is now more difficult but also more rewarding to raise your crown authority.
- Tweaked succession laws to make it possible for non-Basques to use Absolute Cognatic. Authority requirements for other succession laws have also been eased.
- Rebalanced levies and laws that reduce the military capabilities of large kingdoms with weak authority (like France or the HRE).
- More ambitions and plots.
- Women of your dynasty can hold some council positions under Cognatic or Agnatic-Cognatic laws.
- Many minor and major balancing tweaks for a more challenging and enjoyable experience.
- German and French localisation.

****************
* Future Plans *
****************
- More nuanced way of handling prisoners: A count should not be able to execute the child of a king and expect to get away with it scot free.
- More dynamic civil wars: Vassals without high loyalty that demand titles or favors to stay loyal, while loyalist vassals give you additional support.
- Vassals with whom you have marriage alliances become more loyal. Marry your way into a stable realm.
- Rebalance province values to better match history.
- Balanced heresies.
- Even more ambitions and plots.
- More character events, especially everyday life events.

********************
* Optional Modules *
********************
- 'No Time Limit' allows for play up to the year 100000.
- 'No New Empires' disables creation of all of the new Empire-level titles. Note that they will still show up on empire mapmode but cannot possibly be held by a character with this mode on.

******************
* Known Problems *
******************
- None!

*************
* Changelog *
*************
1.06:
- Now compatible with 1.05d.
- Tweaked the Duchies in Syria and Mesopotamia.
- Mongol armies now vary from anywhere between 40k and 100k troops.
- Mongol titles are no longer 'landless', as this resulted in far too many little issues with succession and CBs. Instead, they will now seize a chunk of land around their starting province when they alive, and will be destroyed if their last county is taken. This should fix all the major bugs with Mongols not arriving, having weird successions, etc. As a side effect this also makes it possible to play as the Mongols.
- Properly implemented the 'gain a vassal title' plot.
- Increased chance of heresies appearing.
- Feudal taxation now goes from 5-25% instead of 0-40%, meaning that Feudal vassals are no longer completely tax exempt. This was done to add more of noticeable drawback for the player to be a vassal, since unlike vanilla your liege generally can't call on a significant portion of your troops.
- Slightly increased opinion malus for appointing a Castellan.
- If a Castellan revolts when you try to dismiss him, you will now gain claims on all his titles.
- You can now only appoint a single Castellan (reduced down from two).
- Castellans that are given King titles, numerous Duke titles or a large number of vassals are now more likely to revolt if you try to dismiss them.
- Rulers can now get claims on neighbouring titles via a random event.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing the cooldown on Crusades/Jihads from working correctly.
- Crusades targeting a De Jure Kingdom of an existing Emperor of the same religion will now grant the land to that Emperor (so a Crusade targeting Germany would give the land taken to the HRE).
- When winning lands in a Crusade, you will now get an event that allows you to set up a relative as an independent ruler of a Crusader state, though you may also choose to hold on to the land as before.
- Fixed a bug that caused the Regency trait to not be removed correctly.
- Reduced the frequency of spouses falling in love with each other (it was happening rather too often since the event could fire for either spouse).
- Upped the piety cost of players calling Crusades/Jihads to 500.
- Added a 20 year cooldown on the player calling Crusades/Jihads.

1.05:
- Fixed a major issue that was causing certain CBs not to work.
- The AI will no longer grant Duchies to characters of a different religion.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing Pagan bonus buildings from working.
- The King of Nubia in 1066 is now the correct culture.
- Calling a Crusade or Jihad now costs and requires 250 piety if the player is the one calling it.

1.04:
- Ported over all vanilla character history changes from 1.05.
- Added the decision to appoint up to two male, unlanded, non-primary heir characters as Castellans. Castellans are appointed governors of any titles you grant them, which can be retaken at any time with the 'Dismiss Castellan' decision, allowing you to use them as temporary governors of territory you cannot currently hold yourself, or wish to reserve for a relative in the future. The downside to Castellans is that they are much less efficient at ruling their territories, and will give you less 33% less tax and levies than an ordinary, landed vassal. Appointing Castellans will also slightly upset your hereditary vassals, who do not like the idea of appointed rulers. Muslims do not get Castellans since they have their own appointed ruler system. If a Castellan dies or inherits land, he immediately ceases to be a Castellan and his lands (not including any inheritance) returns to you.
- Empire-level titles will now inherit all laws properly from your primary title on creation.
- Investiture and Title crown laws are now tied to their De Jure Empire in the same way as crown authority.
- You can now press claims for female characters on titles with Cognatic succession. I tested allowing pressing claims on Agnatic-Cognatic but it made expansion far too easy by simply pressing claims for your wife.
- Increased piety cost of hiring Holy Orders.
- Holy Orders will now properly scale with time and religious authority.
- Reworked holy order troop composition to give some variety and also to prevent some holy orders from having an excess amount of certain troop types by end game.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing the 'rebel army rises up' event from firing.
- Heresies now scale better to authority, so you get a gradual decrease/increase of heresies as authority goes up/down rather than a few massive thresholds.
- Reduced the base chance of heresies appearing.
- Reduced the effect of head of religion diplomacy on religious authority. The default state of Catholicism should no longer be 100%.
- Highway Robber Bands, Thieves' Guilds and Smuggler Rings can now appear for rulers without an oversized demesne if their realm stats are low.
- Childbirth deaths will now show up correctly as a death cause.
- Fixed some issues with broken death localisations.
- Reduced province de jure integration time back to 100 years.
- Pagans can now create Scandinavia and all its Kingdom titles.
- Removed all title creation exceptions for non-AI players. Muslim players can no longer create France, etc.
- Dutch provinces can now build the squire list line of buildings. This is a placeholder until I can give them their own building series.
- Many more titular titles are now createable.
- AI characters with the right traits may now choose to hold to Rome despite the Pope's demands.
- Added a CB for Catholic rulers to return Rome to the Pope if another ruler takes it.
- The Pope will now only ask for Rome back once. You won't get the same request for future rulers unless he took it back inbetween.
- Fixed a reversed localisation when rulers join the enemy side in a war.
- Rolled all the Holy War/Religious Invasion CBs into a single Holy War CB with varying piety costs depending on distance and sanction. This was done because the AI did not recognize the new religious CBs and would not join in defensively.
- Reduced AI willingness to join Holy Wars and Crusades.
- Removed the intrigue requirement on starting plots, but made low-intrigue AI characters unlikely to use them.
- Eased up on opinion restrictions on murder plots, especially for characters with traits such as ambitious and cruel.
- Crusades can no longer be declared against heretics, as this resulted in some extremely absurd situations.
- Winning a crusade will no longer give you the Kingdom title, as this resulted in absurdities like an english Duke becoming the King of Germany because of a crusade declared against Mecklenburg.
- Long reign now starts at year 20 instead of year 10.
- Increased opinion malus for denying a vassal a title when they request it via event.
- Reduced the opinion malusus from desiring titles and Not De Jure Liege. Since civil wars are now much more dangerous, I feel that it is a good idea to reduce their frequency a bit, especially to make the AI a more challenging opponent. The effects of these may be raised again if it makes the world too stable.
- The regency triggered modifier is now a trait, that only affects vassal opinion instead of general opinion.
- When a vassal revolts to depose their liege (either via one of the three depose CBs or through a succession crisis), all other vassals will now get an event where they can choose whether or not to join in the revolt. The chance to join depends on traits, relations and dynastic relationships. This should make it significantly more dangerous to provoke your vassals into revolting, since even a small revolt can spiral out of control.
- Tweaked crusade weight chances to cut down on crusades against Sicily and the Wends.
- Added the createable titular kingdom of Aquitaine. Aquitaine can only be created by Occitains that control Bordeaux, and since it is a King-level title you must be independent or the vassal of an Emperor to create it.
- Removed Republic bonus buildings.
- Removed Papal bonus buildings.
- Reduced the power of Pagan bonus buildings.
- Added 1.05's Kingdom/Empire De Jure CBs as an experiment to see whether it has the negative effects on balance that I feared.
- Fixed a bug that was causing friends not to work correctly.
- Disabled the wrong religion occupation penalty, as I feel Holy Wars have been slowed down / made difficult enough that it is not necessary.
- Reduced warscore from battles.
- Fixed some bugs where the 'Win a War' ambition would not complete correctly.
- Fixed a bug with asking for a Sanctioned Holy War where nothing would happen when you took the decision.
- Removed the optional heraldry module until a version can be made that works with the 1.05c patch.
- Fixed a bug where Crusader/Mujahid would not be properly assigned to characters.
- Split up or tweaked many of the largest duchies to make duchy sizes more consistent between different regions.

1.03:
- Added crusade weighting for Kingdoms, so crusades/jihads are not totally random.
- Muslims now have their own Mujahid trait instead of getting the Crusader trait.
- Emperors can no longer create King titles they are the De Jure liege of (to prevent some very ahistorical title creation).
- The character designer will now work properly with CK2+ (ie you can no longer start as a pregnant, beheaded man).
- Reduced the power of republic levy building and made it cost money to build in holdings that do not start with it.
- Made the special republic CB cost prestige to slow down their blobbing.
- Added new CoA patterns from 1.05 to Heraldry mod.
- Fixed a bug that was causing the game to crash if you tried to start after 1204.
- Characters can now plot to assassinate rivals.
- Rügen is now a de jure part of Pomerania.
- Now uses vanilla death reasons instead of death causes mod.

1.02:
- Now compatible with 1.05c. Certain things (like the Kingdom/Empire de jure CBs) were not ported because I feel they break gameplay balance.
- Reduced supply limits experimentally, to see how the improved military AI works out.
- Tribal Invasion CB now targets Kingdoms instead of Duchies.
- Upped De Jure assimilation rate to 200 years.
- Titular Kingdoms (such as the Wends) are now created through 1.05's create titular title mechanic instead of via decision.
- Reduced revolt risk from distance.
- Removed the civil war modifier for now, to see how the new +revolt risk from independence revolts works out. Regency modifier is still in place.
- Removed the war of independence winning all wars of independence mechanic, since new ticking warscore makes it redundant.
- Tweaked the way traits affect piety. All virtues will now give at least a small amount of monthly piety, while all sins will give at least a small malus. The effects of traits such as humble, chaste and lustful that already affected piety were tweaked down to compensate.
- A player that is holding a 'landless' title (such as a mercenary company or a holy order) will now receive a one-time warning that doing so can cause severe bugs with the game.
- Fixed a bug where Kingdom-level titles would sometimes not be grantable to your vassals.
- Rulers whose religion has a religious head can now request sanction for a Holy War or Religious Invasion at a small prestige cost. If granted, it will allow them to wage a Sanctioned Holy War/Religious Invasion that has no piety cost and will give you some piety if you win it. The chance of sanction being granted depends on your piety and head of religion's opinion of you. Requesting sanction can only be done once every five years.
- The AI will now be less keen on doling out its entire demesne to its sons.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing the 'ruler goes native' event from firing.
- Fixed a bug that was causing you to get tyranny when a prisoner died in house arrest.
- Muslims can now get the Crusader trait for participating in Jihads. I will likely make a separate Jihadist trait at some point in the future.
- Temple holdings now give the province they're built in a 10% research boost, even if they don't have any research buildings built.
- You can no longer reorganize flanks. Until Paradox fixes the inherent balance issues with flanks the only real use for this is for player-only exploits.
- Reduced the size of the Norman, English and Norwegian armies in the Stamford Bridge scenario. While the armies are now smaller than they were historically, they are no longer confusingly out of sync with the actual army sizes in the rest of the mod.
- CK2Plus now features full French localisation.
- When taking or extending a loan you will now get a character modifier showing you when the loan is due.
- Restored the family trees that were broken to prevent certain claims from existing. Instead, those claims will be removed by a startup event that fires shortly after game start.
- You must no longer have the prestige on hand to fabricate claims, but you cannot fabricate claims if your prestige is below 0.
- The final level of Heavy Armor is now actually an upgrade.
- Titles created by decision will now inherit the succession law of your primary title (no more forming Empires with Gavelkind).
- You can no longer grant independence to De Jure vassals, to prevent certain exploits with De Jure CBs.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing the AI from abandoning certain failed plots and objectives.
- Renamed 'Get a Lover' to 'Fall in Love' to make it more appropriate for when the ambition is completed by falling in love with your spouse.
- Fixed a bug where 'Get a Lover' would abort if the character is chaste.
- Replaced the Pagan bonus buildings with culture buildings, so that foreign conquerors do not get the benefit of them.

1.01:
- CK2Plus now features full German localisation support.
- Contagious diseases are now rarer but more deadly.
- Changed scale of morale break threshold from 25-50% to 10-50% so martial skill is even more decisive.
- Added two new merc fleets, one in the black sea and the other near the holy land.
- Added five additional 500 man merc groups, non-hireable by the AI (located in: baltic, germany, balkans, egypt, arabia).
- Holy Wars will no longer result in gaining the target Duchy title, as it has proved impossible to fix the bugs and weird vassals gained from doing so.
- AI characters can now a pick a 'cooldown' ambition that is meant to reduce the frequency of murder plots occuring simply because they have nothing else to do.
- Added new ambitions: Convert a Province, Win a War, Gain Honorary Title, Adopt a Lifestyle, Gain a Kingdom and Become Emperor.
- Characters must now have at least 5 intrigue to start a plot.
- Religious conversion chance is now increased by having a large demesne.
- You must now be independent to grant a vassal independence.
- Granting independence to a De Jure vassal now costs 100 prestige, compared to 25 for releasing a not De Jure vassal.
- It no longer costs piety to imprison, exile or execute characters. While I think the piety costs make sense, it's rather strange that the actions are impossible to carry out if your piety is negative - why would low piety stop a cynical, depraved character from killing anyone?
- You can now declare war on characters that are either plotting to kill your close relatives or sheltering characters plotting to kill your close relatives in their realm. A victory will imprison all such plotters in your dungeon.
- Legitimizing Bastards is now done under Character Decisions.
- You can now declare Religious Defense on a ruler whose vassals are fighting some form of Holy War.
- Winning a Religious Defense war will now also end all variants of offensive Holy Wars their vassals are fighting against characters of your religion.
- The AI will no longer fight third-party claim wars where the claimaint would not end up as their vassal.
- The third-party claim war tooltip will now show you whether the claimaint will end up becoming your vassal after the peace or not.
- You can no longer declare third-party claim wars on a character that you already installed in a title via another third-party claim war. This is to prevent players from repeatedly invading the same County for prestige..
- Provinces with a revolt in progress should now show up as deep red on the revolt risk map.
- Gender succession laws can now only be changed one 'step' at a time (so you can't change from Agnatic to Cognatic or vice-versa, you have to first make it Agnatic-Cognatic).
- Revoking a title now always costs 100 prestige (to prevent a Muslim ruler from going completely nuts with revocations).
- Muslim rulers can now appoint up to 3 concubines from unmarried women in their court. Concubines will have legitimate children with their liege. If a concubine gets married or moves to a different court, she ceases to be a concubine.
- Muslim vassals can now plot to institute hereditary titles.
- Muslim rulers now have a new crown law category: Titles. This crown law determines whether titles can be freely revoked (without relation hits to other vassals), representing the Muslim system of appointed rather than hereditary rulers. Having the free revocation law in effect will make your vassals like you less, and they can still refuse and revolt when you try to revoke their titles. 
- Reworked the Award Honorary Title diplomatic action into a Character Decisions menu that contains both honorary titles and new character decisions.
- Added the 'Grant Independence' character decision that allows you to set a vassal free at the cost of a relations and prestige hit.
- Added the 'Revoke Honorary Title' character decision that allows you to revoke an honorary title. This will cause a relations hit unless the title you were revoking was that of Court Jester.
- Tweaked Papal name list to contain mostly names that were actually used during the CK2 era.
- Restored the Almoravid claims but made them an Emirate instead of a Sultanate in 1066, to give other Muslim rulers in the area a fighting chance.
- Split the Duchy of Marrakech into the Duchies of Marrakech and Ifni.
- Fixed some bugs with holy orders.
- Scaled Amass Wealth and Become Exalted Among Men ambitions to your title rank, to make them more feasible to achieve for a Count and more difficult to achieve for a King or Emperor.
- Reduced frequency of non immediate family (sibling or child) relatives asking you for titles.
- Relatives who are offended by your refusal to give them a title may now plot to force the issue.
- Relatives who ask for titles will now usually be offended if you deny them. If you have decent diplomacy you may be able avoid offending them.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing the AI from executing assassination plots.
- The AI will now abandon objectives after ten years of failing to fulfill them.
- Prestigious vassals can now plot to acquire their liege's primary title, even if they do not have a claim on it.
- Vassals can now plot against a liege that is not their top liege, making it more dangerous for a vassal lord to anger their own vassals.
- Fixed a bug with Arrange Courtier Marriages where it would spawn multiple women with the same name.
- Rebalanced the effects of levy laws. They will provide less minimum levies, but have less of an impact on relations as well.
- There are now five levels of each tax and levy law instead of four. This means that realms with an active crown law will always be able to have higher law settings than one completely without.
- Fixed a persistent bug where children would always be stillborn if their mother died in childbirth.
- Reduced the overall frequency of genetics traits when not inherited from parents (so you'll have less dwarven hunchback debutantes showing up at court).
- Decreased chance of inheriting Quick, Genius, Slow and Imbecile.
- Increased chance of inheriting Tall.
- Fabricating claims now has a fixed gold cost equal to the prestige cost. However, unlike prestige you do not need to have the gold on hand.
- Reduced the number of heavy cavalry gained from the German/Frankish culture buildings.

1.00:
- It is now possible to sail between the Nile Delta and the Gulf of Suez. This is necessary because otherwise the AI has issues with getting its troops stuck waiting for ships on the other side.
- Added decisions to form special titular Kingdoms for Muslims in Iberia.
- Reduced piety gain from handing titles to church, so that it is not possible to wage perpetual Holy War simply by handing out the temples you gain.
- A white peace in an independence war will no longer result in independence.
- Winning an independence war will now result in all other independence wars against the same target being automatically won. Ideally I would have liked to make independence war a war where you can call in other vassals who also become independent if you win, but this does not seem to be possible to do.
- Winning a war to replace your liege (by any of the various CBs) will now end any wars with the same general goal inconclusively.
- Winning a Religious Defense war will now end any offensive Crusade or Religious Wars the enemy is fighting against your religion. Any other Religious Defense wars your faith is waging against the same target will also end inconclusively.
- It is now possible to wage Holy War against distant enemies. Such a war is distinguished by a different name: Religious Invasion. A Religious Invasion costs 250 piety and cannot be declared if your piety is below 0.
- It now costs 100 piety to wage a Holy War on a neighbouring enemy. You cannot declare a Holy War if your piety is below 0. This is meant to represent Church/Temple approval of your war, and also to slow down the general pace of expansion.
- Changed the way invasions work. Instead of taking all occupied titles, you now get all titles the target character was holding which fall under the Kingdom you were invading. So if William wins the Norman Invasion, he takes the Kingdom of England and all English Counties, Duchies and Baronies Harold was holding.
- Pagans can now wage Holy Wars.
- Made the AI more reluctant to expand into Ethiopia.
- Axum is once again independent at game start.
- Added preferred terrain types for different unit/tactics. For instance, Pikemen will perform better in hills and mountains but poorly in forests, while light cavalry will do well in forests and deserts but poorly in mountains.
- Changed all battle tactic stats into standardized formulas.
- Linked battle morale break point with generals martial stat (flanks with no general will break at 50% morale, decreasing in increments to 25% break point at 20+ martial skill).
- Added mild defensive bonuses to most terrain types.
- Added the Have Fifteen Children and Have Twenty Children ambitions. Completing the Have Twenty Children ambition will give you a special nickname.
- Orthodox Priests can now marry.
- AI Barons will now get married instead of letting their dynasties die out.
- Feasts, Grand Hunts and Summer Fairs now cost a fixed amount of money depending on your title rank. Many of the events related to them have also been given fixed gold costs.
- Titular titles can no longer have Elective succession (as they have no valid electors).
- You now have a small chance of fabricating claims on a Duchy, even if your Chancellor has < 15 skill.
- Your chance of successfully fabricating a claim is now increased by having high prestige.
- Increased the prestige cost of fabricating claims to 200/500 for County/Duchy.
- Increased the wrong holding type penalty to -66%.
- Reduced the effects of ambitious and content to -30/+30 respectively.
- Added a decision to automatically arrange marriages for all eligible bachelors in your court. The characters will primarily marry women in your court, but if there is not enough women then random spouses will be generated for them. This decision is meant for people like me who like to have a large court but don't want to go through the tedious micromanagement of finding spouses for every male courtier. Close relatives of yours will not be affected by this decision, so you won't accidentally marry your son or daughter to a courtier.
- Switching out of Elective now requires High Crown Authority.
- Localisation should no longer be a mess in non-default language settings, though all the text from the mod will be in English.
- Tweaked province names, laws and borders in Poland.
- Integrated the 'Offer You Can't Refuse' mod that adds Sicilian cultural melting pots.
- Characters now have a 5% chance of gaining the culture of their province shortly after birth.
- Rulers can now 'go native', converting them and any children of theirs below the age of 16 to the culture of their capital province. Kings and Emperors are much less likely to go native. The chance to go native goes down with age. The player gets an option to avoid it happening to their character.
- Removed Warrior Cults. Instead, Pagans start with more regular troop buildings.
- East Africa, Sicily and Christian Iberia now start with more troop buildings.
- Removed the direct warscore bonus for holding contested settlements.
- Doubled the yearly warscore bonus for holding contested settlements.
- Tweaked it so that Barons can't convert the culture of a province. This should slow down rate of culture conversion.
- Reduced truce time for Ducal Claim wars to 6 years.
- Reduced truce time for County Claim wars to 3 years.
- The ruler of Mallorca in 1066 is now much more historical.
- Religious Head and Holy Order titles will now automatically convert characters holding them to their religion.
- Rebalanced province values in Russia and Scandinavia. Overall development potential of provinces was reduced.
- You will no longer have vassals declare independence wars without warning. Instead, vassal revolt risk and effects of regencies/civil wars were tweaked so that revolt chain reactions should happen on their own (see below).
- Added a decision to become King of Wends if you are Wend Pagan ruler that holds the Duchies of Brandenburg, Mecklenburg, Pommerania or Pomeralia either directly or through vassals.
- The AI will now make proper use of demesne laws.
- Tax laws are now tied to crown authority in the same way as Levy laws. Default tax laws are None for Feudal vassals and Minimum for Church and City vassals. This should put large Duchies at more of a disadvantage to proper Kingdoms.
- Added the county of Teate in Benevento to make the borders between Sicily and Lombardy more historical.
- Fixed some bugs related to heresies.
- You will no longer get tyranny from characters dying in your prison unless they died as a result of illnesses contracted from being in prison.
- Sick or injured prisoners will now ask for better accomondations, even if they were previously denied them. This is meant to give the player a second chance to avoid a tyranny hit if a prisoner falls ill.
- The dungeon and the oubliette no longer give direct health maluses, instead they make it much more likely to catch an illness.
- Rebalanced the Mongols to have fewer but larger stacks.
- Reduced the effects of dynastic prestige on marriages and newly born characters (having babies born with 500 prestige was getting silly).
- Winning a Holy War or Crusade will now result in taking the Duchy title the war was for, if the enemy is holding it. You still get all the holdings in the Duchy.
- Created an event will make the AI much smarter about handing out newly created Duchy titles, preferring to give them to Counts with their capital in the right area, or alternatively granting them along with a County to a Courtier, only granting a Duke title to an existing Duke if there are no better alternatives. This will only sometimes work on revoked/usurped titles, as the AI is sometimes too fast for my handout event to take effect.
- The Duchy of Tyrol is no longer divided by impassable mountains.
- Tweaked some weirdly shaped provinces.
- Tweaked Duchy borders in Algiers, and added the Duchy of Atlas.
- Added Ibiza as a County in the Duchy of Mallorca.
- Added the Kingdom of Azerbaijan as a de jure part of the Empire of Persia, composed of the Duchies of Tabriz, Azerbaijan and Derbent.
- Pommerania is now de jure a part of Germany.
- Salzburg is now a de jure part of Austria.
- Grisons is now a de jure part of Tyrol.
- Viviers is now a de jure part of Auvergne.
- Anhalt is now a de jure part of Brandenburg.
- Fejer is now a de jure part of Esztergom.
- Vendome is now a de jure part of Anjou.
- Damman and Basra are now de jure parts of Arabia.
- Jacwiez and Yatvagi are now de jure part of Lithuania.
- Rebellions will now rarely result in a large rebel army rising up. If the rebels take control of a province, the chance of bad rebel events (like burned buildings or killed province lords) increases, and the province may defect.
- Integrated 'culturally different cities' mod which gives different culture groups their own distinct city graphics.
- Rebalanced culture buildings so that different culture groups are roughly on part with each other.
- Cost of tech growth buildings is now consistent at 200 gold per 10% growth speed the building confers.
- Khazars now start with 2 provinces, and Itil was split into the Duchies of Itil and Saray so that nobody will have a ducal claim on them. This should give them a chance of surviving past the first five minutes of the game.
- Reduced the relations penalty for title claimaints.
- Stressed and Depressed are now mutually exclusive.
- When a character with the dishonorable trait dies, their heir will now get a 'dynastic stain' trait that confers diplomatic penalties equal to their predecessor's level of dishonorable, but which does not qualify you for excommunication or other ill effects of being dishonorable. If a character with dynastic stain is caught assassinating, the dynastic stain turns into a regular dishonorable trait at one level above what their dynastic stain level was at. Assuming you keep dynastic stain from being turned into dishonorable, it will not be transferred over to your heir. This change is meant to  add additional risk to inheritance-by-assassination, as you can now not simply wash away the consequenses by dying.
