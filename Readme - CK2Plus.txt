* Installation *
****************
1) If you have an older version of the mod installed, go into the Crusader Kings II mod folder and delete the 'CK2Plus' folder and .mod file.
2) Unzip to your Crusader Kings II folder. IMPORTANT: The mod files should go into your GAME INSTALLATION folder, NOT your My Documents/Paradox Interactive folder. For Steam users, the game directory is found in the steam folder, under steamapps/common/crusader kings II.
3) If you have the Steam version of CK2, you may need to unzip to your My Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings II folder in ADDITION to unzipping to your game directory as outlined in step 2.
4) Unzip any Hotfixes to your Crusader Kings II folder (same place you installed the mod in step 2).
5) Start the CK2 launcher and check 'CK2+ X.XX' in the list of mods.
6) Check any optional modules you want to use along with CK2Plus.
7) Hit play.

CK2Plus is a collaborative effort. While most of the work is done by me personally, it also includes parts of many other mods (see credits for full list). You are free to use any part of this mod in your own mods as long as you give due credit to the creator of said part.

************
* Features *
************
- More provinces and sea zones.
- Martial and Learning are no longer useless stats for rulers, as the former will affect the size of your levies and the latter determines your chance of spreading your culture and religion to your provinces.
- Reduced fertility/health and altered attributes for old characters: 80-year olds will no longer have a new child every year while leading their armies from the front, and characters that live to very old ages are suitably rare.
- New tyranny system that assigns reasonable but noticeable penalties for imprisoning, banishing and executing characters and allows for more leeway in dealing with traitors.
- New education system. Children's attributes now matter in how well they take to an education (so a high martial child will do better in a martial education), and characters will not simply always end up having the exact same education trait as their tutor.
- Crusades can result in independent Crusader states with a special truce that makes them able to survive their first few years. A Crusade for Jerusalem will now much more closely mirror the historical First Crusade with an independent Jerusalem being created.
- Civil wars are more dangerous: A revolting vassal that is trying to depose you will ask all other vassals to join him, which can result in a major revolt among vassals that like him better than they like you.
- Councillor opinions of you matter: A councillor that really likes you will work harder and do better at his job, while one that dislikes you will perform worse.
- Holy Wars cost piety to fight, so that the general rate of expansion in Iberia and the Middle East is slowed. Overseas Holy Wars cost a large amount of piety, and the AI will largely avoid fighting them. Crusades/Jihads are not affected.
- More lethal diseases and battles, making medieval life the violent and uncertain existance it should be.
- Many more Empires and Kingdoms to create.
- Dynamic Kingdom creation system where de jure Kingdoms are createable by anyone, but certain Kingdoms will change their names depending on which religion is holding them.
- Rebalanced combat where the martial score of the generals is an important factor.
- More mercenaries and holy orders.
- More cultures.
- It is now more difficult but also more rewarding to raise your crown authority.
- Tweaked succession laws to make it possible for non-Basques to use Absolute Cognatic. Authority requirements for other succession laws have also been eased.
- Rebalanced levies and laws that reduce the military capabilities of large kingdoms with weak authority (like France or the HRE).
- Many more ambitions and plots.
- Women of your dynasty can hold some council positions under Cognatic or Agnatic-Cognatic laws.
- Many minor and major balancing tweaks for a more challenging and enjoyable experience.
- German and French localisation.

****************
* Future Plans *
****************
- More nuanced way of handling prisoners: A count should not be able to execute the child of a king and expect to get away with it scot free.
- More dynamic civil wars: Vassals without high loyalty that demand titles or favors to stay loyal, while loyalist vassals give you additional support.
- Vassals with whom you have marriage alliances become more loyal. Marry your way into a stable realm.
- Even more ambitions and plots.
- More character events, especially everyday life events.

********************
* Optional Modules *
********************
- 'BLC' (Better Looking Characters) adds new and more historical portaits, clothes, hairstyles, beards and so on for the characters in the game. Not recommended for users with less than 2gb of RAM. BLC requires the Mongol Face Pack DLC to work correctly.
- 'No Time Limit' allows for play up to the year 100000.

******************
* Known Problems *
******************
- None!

* Changelog *
*************
1.16:
- Added more culture-specific buildings.
- Slightly increased effects of stewardship on demesne size.
- Fixed a bug with tourneys that caused them to not end correctly.
- Fixed some bugs with localisation and graphics on the 'Befriend Top Liege' ambition.
- Reduced the effects of difficulty on councillor actions (they were a bit extreme).
- Fixed some problems with the loading order of the mod.
- Fixed a bug where a woman could become simultaneously pregnant with her spouse and her lover.

1.15:
- Now compatible with version 1.05g.
- Upgraded to the latest version of Better Looking Characters, which features a number of performance improvements that should make it less memory intensive.
- Integrated Mercator Mod, which improves greatly on the game's terrain with proper mountain placement, river locations, etc.
- Titular titles will now never be elective when created.
- If your demesne laws are higher than what crown authority allows (for example because crown authority went down) an event will now fire that adjusts them to their highest allowed level.
- Added events for pious Muslim or Christian rulers to sponsor missions to a neighbouring Pagan ruler, which have a chance of converting that ruler to the sponsor's faith.
- Reworked the effects of difficulty. Instead of providing flat bonuses to the player or the AI, difficulty now instead influences things such as councillor actions, loans and vassal loyalty. A player on low difficulty will (to name a few effects) find it easier to fabricate claims and have vassals stay loyal during civil wars, while getting the opposite effect on high difficulty. A high difficulty AI will get more claims, better terms on loans and other such things to make up for its various shortcomings versus a player. On Normal, AIs play almost entirely by the same rules as a player. Only a single flat bonus was left in place: Siege speed. High difficulty AIs will be more difficult to siege to account for their tendency to only siege a single province at once.
- Victory in a succession war will now result in taking all the enemy's titles you have claims on in addition to taking the title whose succession you were disputing.
- Reworked civil wars. Vassals who choose to side with their liege will now actively join the war and raise their troops to fight the traitors. To compensate for this, the base chance of vassals joining a civil war was increased.
- AI vassals will now be reluctant to rebel against an AI ruler that has recently been in a civil war.
- It is once again possible for your character's culture to spread to your capital, even if there is no adjacent province of the same culture. The chance is greatly reduced unless your character is independent.
- Neighbours will no longer get a religious call to arms when war is declared between characters of the same religion group (as long as one is not a heresy of the other).
- Further refined education formula. The child's attributes are now more important than the tutor's trait in how well they take to their education, though educator trait still makes a significant difference. Overall frequency of level 3 and 4 education traits were lowered.
- Nearly all decisions now have graphical icons to make them more immediately visually identifiable.
- Martial skill is now much more important in determining who wins a grand tournament.
- Upped Kingdom creation cost to 500 gold and Empire creation cost to 1000 gold.
- Further decreased effects of personal stewardship on demesne limit.
- Removed piety cost for Kingdom creation. While it makes sense for Catholics, it doesn't for pretty much every other faith and it always felt strange how impious, ambitious characters were locked out of making themselves Kings.
- AI rulers will now only attempt to Restore the Papacy once after it is lost. If they make the attempt and fail, the same character will not try again.
- Attempts to Restore the Papacy to Rome can now only be made for 100 years after it is lost.
- De Jure claim wars now always result in seizing the province, to prevent the situations where you would force-vassalize a character and he would revolt immediately as the war ends.
- State martial skill now influences the amount of troops you can raise from your vassals.
- The AI will now usurp Kingdoms that it controls more than 50% of the land in, even if it already has a Kingdom or Empire level title.
- The AI will no longer limit itself to a single Kingdom, creating any Kingdom titles it is eligible for with the exception of titles inside a de jure empire that it holds.
- Added titular Kingdoms of Bavaria, Prussia and Khazaria.
- If a titular kingdom turns de jure, the special creation/usurp penalties from it are now removed (so if the Kingdom of Venice has de jure land, it is no longer only holdable by republics, for example).
- Players without an ambition will now suffer a penalty to their prestige (to prevent an exploit where the player would only pick ambitions as they are about to complete).
- Removed the 'No New Empires' module (as it no longer serves a purpose).
- Implemented a new system of dynamic empires. All de jure Empires except the HRE and Byzantium are now gone, and are instead replaced by a large number of titular empires that can be formed by any ruler with the right culture and 4 kingdom titles. The following empires are currently createable via this system: Latin Empire, Frankish Empire, Occitan Empire, Italian Empire, Roman Empire, Polish Empire, Russian Empire, Persian Empire, Danubian Empire, Spanish Empire, Maghreb Empire, Arabian Empire, Egyptian Empire, Celtic Empire, Nordic Empire, Ethiopian Empire, Britannian Empire, Mali Empire, Lithuanian Empire, Finnish Empire, Magyar Empire, Seljuk Turks, Ottoman Empire and Al-Andalus.
- Removed all religion limits on creating de jure kingdom titles. Instead, some titles will have an 'alternate' version for muslims, and on creating that title the non-muslim title will be destroyed and the muslim title will take its place. If the muslim title is then destroyed and re-created by christians or pagans, it reverts to the non-muslim version. (For example: If a muslim ruler creates Portugal, he will get the Sultanate of Al-Garb instead, with Portugal's de jure lands. If his realm is wiped out and Al-Garb is created by a Christian, that Christian will get the Kingdom of Portugal).
- Fixed some bugs related to starting succession laws. As a result, you will be unable to change succession laws in the first week or so after starting a new game.
- Heresies no longer affect or are affected by moral authority changes from Holy Wars and province conversion.
- Courtiers can now take lovers among other courtiers, and young men or women with much older spouses will be particularily suspectible to romance.
- Changing succession laws now requires and costs 125/250/500/750/1000 prestige for Barons/Counts/Dukes/Kings/Emperors respectively. Changing gender succession laws does not cost prestige.
- Removed crown law requirements for switching succession laws. Medium Crown Authority is still required for switching an Elective Kingdom or Empire away from being Elective.
- You can no longer complete the 'Amass Wealth' objective by taking a loan.
- Increased base amount of troops from holdings.
- Increased build cost of holdings.
- Fixed a bug that caused countries to incorrectly become independent when a third-party claim was pressed.
- Revamped tyranny mechanics. When you perform tyrannical actions (such as imprisoning, banishing or executing characters) without a rightful cause, you will now get tyranny 'points' that translate into a Tyrant trait with a potency from 1 to 100. For each point of tyranny, you suffer penalties to prestige and vassal opinion. Imprisoning and executing characters when you have rightful cause to do so (for example if they rebelled against you) will not result in any tyranny, and the tyranny penalties for banishment are lowered if you have rightful cause. Note that a character revolting/acting dishonorably towards you will only give you cause for ONE punishment, so you can either revoke, banish OR execute them... additional punishments will result in normal amounts of tyranny. Tyranny goes away over time, and will not be inherited by your successor when you die.
- You will now get kinslayer only for executing or assassinating close relatives (rather than any dynasty member).
- Fixed some issues with weird/conflicting assassination plot requirements.
- AI characters that have been caught assassinating before are now less likely to plan new assassinations.
- A character that wins an invasion will now get claims on all Counties and Duchies in the target Kingdom.
- You can no longer pick the ambition to befriend a character you are at war with (and the ambition will abort if you go to war with them).
- Added an ambition to befriend your top liege (if not the same as your direct liege).

1.14:
- Better Looking Characters is now an optional module that requires the Mongol Faces DLC. If you are having issues with graphics, performance or load times, try playing without BLC as it increases CK2's memory usage considerably.

1.13:
- Upgraded to version 7 of Better Looking Characters.
- Fixed a bug that was causing feasts, hunting and summer fairs to become permanently unavailable for a character.
- Jews can now create the Kingdom of Jerusalem.
- Harder difficulty levels will no longer increase AI income, but will lower player income instead (for players who think money is too plentiful).
- Tweaked a vanilla event that was causing Catholic moral authority to increase far too quickly.
- How you vote on your liege's law proposals will now influence his or her opinion of you.
- Fixed a rare bug that would result in characters being given two education traits.
- Further decreased chances of children picking up the higher level education traits.
- When a character usurps  their liege's primary title, they will now also take the liege's capital province (so that if a pretender seizes the Byzantine Empire they should also get Constantinople, for example).
- Corrected some newly introduced performance issues.
- Courtiers with honorary titles and money will now marry on their own unless that honorary title is Court Jester or Concubine.
- Extending a loan will now only extend it for two years.
- Exiling characters now costs prestige, to prevent an exploit where a low ranked player could repeatedly imprison and banish his baron vassals for large sums of money.
- Players can now complete many ambitions multiple times, although the rewards for completing them are greatly lessened after the first time.
- Fixed a bug where lack of crown laws would incorrectly reset your demesne laws to the lowest level.
- Fixed some bugs with lover events where women could get impregnated by their female lovers.
- Female councillors will no longer marry other women.

1.12:
- Now compatible with official patch 1.05f.
- Upgraded to latest version of Culturally Different Cities.
- The Komnenos dynasty now starts with claims to Byzantium in 1066.
- Kingdoms and Empires must now have at least Medium crown authority to fight a de jure war over a province whose Duchy they do not control.
- Removed the attribute nerfs on birth since new education system makes them redundant (and I can always just tweak good education trait chances down if stat inflation becomes a problem again).
- Added a new education system. Children will now get an education trait sometime between the age of 15 and 16 instead of getting it on their 16th birthday. The trait they get will always be the same archetype as their tutor (ie a tutor with an intrigue trait will generate an intrigue trait for their student) but which trait the child gets is now influenced by the child's own attributes, so a high martial child is likely to do well in a martial education for example. Randomization was also increased so the child doesn't just get the exact same trait as their tutor almost every time. Overall, the higher end education traits should now be significantly rarer.
- Added a notification event that fires when one of your close relatives turns 16, letting you know that they are an adult and which education trait they got (to compensate for the lack of an education notification).
- Reduced the power/cost of universities and increased the power/cost of monastic schools, to make Temples the foremost holding for research speed.
- Decreased the chance of healthy women dying in childbirth.
- Upgraded to latest version of family relations mod.
- Sped up the spread of English and Sicilian cultures.
- The learning and piety of a head of religion will now influence the moral authority of that religion through events.
- Randomly generated characters (both at game start and after) should now properly get assigned genetic traits.
- Removed the Arrange Courtier Marriages decision. Instead, courtiers with money and a position on your council will marry on their own.
- Reduced the piety cost of early Crusades, to make Crusade-less games less likely.
- When you win an independence war, the defeated ruler will now get claims on your titles.
- Changed the way loans work. Instead of an event that fires when you go into the red, a loan can now be taken at any time through a decision. The loan amount scales to your income, and is always a five-year loan at 25% interest. If you do not have the money to pay it back on the due date, you can extend it for another five years by paying the interest. If your character dies with an unpaid loan, the debt will be transfered to your heir.
- The AI will now make use of loans during wartime in order to buy mercenaries and fund its armies.
- AI will now only change succession laws under fairly specific circumstances (so half the world won't switch to Primogeniture on day one of the game).
- Reduced the penalty for characters dying in prison.
- Reduced the chance of prisoners in the dungeon falling ill.
- Imprisoned characters can no longer join a revolt.
- Increased the chance of characters with titles escaping from prison. The higher ranked the character, the higher the chance of them making the attempt.
- Reduced starting troop multiplier for Alp Arslan (due to the changes below).
- Added more buildings to the Seljuk Turks and increased the strength of the Ghilmans.
- Removed some holdings in Byzantium and reduced the strength of the Varangian Guard.
- Further improved performance by removing some unnecessary AI checks and moving others to events.
- Added two new ambitions: Befriend Liege and Befriend Head of Religion.
- Building destruction on siege events should now work correctly.
- Added two events associated with the 'Research Economy Tech' action. The positive event improves province prosperity, while the negative event results in temporary revolt risk.
- Center leader martial skill is now a very important factor for reducing attrition to your troops.
- Reduced the effects of Siege Equipment, to balance out for the removal of Military Fortifications.
- Replaced the Military Fortifications tech with Logistics, which increases supply limits to better correspond to later game army sizes.
- Attrition is once again a factor in war, although at greatly reduced maximum rates and heavily tweaked holding supply effects.
- Reduced garrison sizes to make stalled wars less likely.
- Increased effectiveness of defending garrison during assaults (to make up for lower numbers).
- Tweaked province prosperity events so that the extreme ends of the spectrum (Rich/Struggling) are less common.
- When pushing third-party claims, the tooltip will no longer say that the claimaint will become your landed vassal if that is not possible because the pushed title is equal or higher rank than your own.
- When pushing third-party claims, the claimaint will now remain your vassal if the title you are pushing is in the same realm as your own (ie held by your liege or one of his/her vassals).
- Pushing a third-party claim will no longer turn a character independent if the title you pushed for him or her was not already independent.
- You can now plot to kill characters whose title you or your child is a pretender to.
- Removed the demesne size requirements for raising crown authority, as they all too often locked the AI at autonomous vassals.
- Most titles formable by Christians are now also formable by Pagans.
- Kingdom of Wends can now be formed by Wends of any religion.

1.11:
- Fixed a CTD on startup caused by the lack of congenital/birth traits.

1.10:
- Fixed a bug that was causing characters to get dynastic stain when they should not be.
- Fixed a bug that was causing regency trait not to be applied properly.
- Fixed a bug that was causing congenital traits not to be distributed properly.
- Learning will now influence province prosperity, so a high state learning will make it more likely for your provinces to grow prosperous and less likely for them to become poor.
- The AI will now favor vassals that have the 'Gain Honorary Title' ambition when handing out honorary titles.
- Increased opinion bonus for dynasty back to +10.
- Reduced opinion bonus for sibling from 20 to 15.
- Reintroduced monthly authority loss for creating an Anti-Pope, but greatly reduced the initial authority loss (This should make Anti-Popes a 'hot potato').

1.09:
- Fixed a bug that was causing significant slowdown due to bloated AI courts. Game performance should now be much better.
- Moved most CK2+ events to the yearly or bi-yearly character event pulses to further improve performance.
- Increased AI tendency to plot.
- Reduced opinion bonus for same dynasty.
- Integrated avee's family relations mod that increases character's opinions of their close family.
- Realms without crown authority can now have up to the second level of taxation/levy laws.
- Fixed a bug that was breaking the invasion CB.
- Further improved title distribution AI, to make the AI less willing to hand away its demesne when there are other alternatives.
- Added dynasty, culture and religion information to character tooltips.
- Reduced minimum gift size (but kept the increased gift scaled cost the same).
- Increased the plot power required to execute the better assassination decisions, and also slightly increased their chance of success.
- Removed Castellans. While I feel they are a good feature, I couldn't find a way to fix the various bugs and issues with the way honorary titles are coded, and I don't want to have a permanently half-broken feature in the mod.
- Greatly increased prestige gain from winning battles.
- Reworked the way joining wars works. The ask to join war diplomatic mechanic is now reserved solely for Crusades. Instead, when a ruler is declared on by a ruler of a different faith for any conquest-type CB (holy war, claim, de jure claim, etc), they get the option to ask all their neighbours of the same faith (neighbour being defined as sharing a border or sharing provinces in the same kingdom). Chance of joining depends on relations, traits, dynastic ties and other such factors. This should make the AI far more reasonable and realistic about which holy wars it joins (you no longer get all of North Africa defending Sicily, for instance), and simultaneously eliminates the exploit of using other CBs to get around holy war defensive chains.
- Reduced demesne size requirements for raising crown authority to a level the AI can better cope with.
- Buildings can now be randomly destroyed as a consequense of provinces being besieged.
- Added province prosperity mechanics. Provinces now have a prosperity level that goes (in descending order): Rich - Prosperous - Normal - Poor - Struggling. Prosperity level affects the tax and levies you can get from the province, and will go up and down from various events. Peace and quiet tends to increase province prosperity, while war and rebellions reduces it.
- Restored the ability for women to pass on pressable claims to their kids. This makes it possible once again to marry into claims.
- Province conversions will now very slightly increase the moral authority of the converting religion, and decrease the authority of the converted.
- Religions no longer gain any moral authority from the diplomacy of their head of religion.
- Anti-Popes no longer cause continous moral authority loss, but the moral authority loss from creating one was greatly increased.
- Reduced the moral authority hit to the loser in a Crusade.
- Reduced frequency of heresies.
- Reduced maintenance cost of levies.
- Reduced the bonus troops granted to rulers defending against a Crusade/Jihad.
- The Almoravids once again start as a Sultanate instead of an Emirate, as this leads to more historical results.
- Fixed a bug where the Pope getting the land in a Crusade would result in a smattering of independent counts.
- The inherited/appointed titles law is now available to Byzantium (to represent the Theme system).
- Added the titular kingdoms of Sardinia, Dublin, Mann and the Isles, Mercia and Cornwall.
- Newborn characters now start with negative stats, in an effort to reduce the extreme stat inflation from education over time. An adjustment event fires later in childhood to ensure that base stats do not remain in the negative.
- Removed the vassal opinion bonus from Elective. While it makes sense, it feel it makes an already extremely good succession law even better.
- Primogeniture no longer lowers the opínion of your dynasty.
- Elective now lowers the opinion of your dynasty (due to opening up the succession outside of the bloodline).
- Tweaked mercenaries to have more 500 and 1000-size companies.
- Added mercenaries to West Africa.
- Tweaked provinces in West Africa and added an additional province to the Duchy of Laayoune.
- Fixed a bug where changing the crown authority of an Empire would cause multiple stacking opinion penalties.

1.08:
- Players can now do De Jure wars against other religion groups, until I rework the way joining Holy Wars works.
- Tumbling your courtiers is no longer a male-only or straight-only activity.
- Crusader states should now always become Feudal, even if the most participating attacker in the Crusade is not.
- Halved the effects of legalism on demesne size.
- Vassals will no longer join a claim on liege war that is not targeting one of the liege's primary-level titles. This should prevent situations where you are fighting your liege for a claim on a vassal and that vassal joins the war on your side.
- Tweaked West Africa to be slightly more historical and considerably more balanced.
- Increased frequency of bad events (buildings destroyed, characters killed, armies rising up) from revolts.
- Restored economic buildings to former levels, with the exception of ports as they made coastal cities rather overpowered at their previous income levels.
- If you press a claim of lower rank than their primary title on behalf of a vassal, they will now stay in your realm (so you can press Count claims on behalf of Dukes, etc).
- Fixed some issues with weird straits caused by province realigning.
- You can no longer declare third-party de jure wars on characters of a different religion group.

1.07:
- Now compatible with version 1.05e.
- Ran the mod through the validator and fixed numerous minor errors.
- De Jure vassals are now more inclined to choose depose CBs over independence war CBs.
- Reduced the number of short reign years but increased the opinion penalties for Regency, to make succession issues rarer but more serious.
- Reduced the opinion boost for being entrusted with a ward.
- Increased the cost of gifts, to make the cost better scaled to how powerful they have become (I would reduce their opinion effects if I could).
- Reduced the dynastic opinion bonus to 15 on account of the tendency of dynasty members to stay loyal during revolts by non-dynasty members and the reduced opinion maluses from title claimaints.
- The cost of fabricating claims now scales with your primary title level. Fabricating a claim on a County/Duchy costs 100/200, 150/300 and 200/400 for Counts, Dukes and Kings/Emperors respectively.
- A character that wins their invasion war (for example, William the Conqueror if he wins the Norman Invasion) now gains a ten-year truce modifier that prevents all external wars, in the same way newly formed crusader states do.
- Holy Orders will now get the ten-year truce modifier when they are granted a piece of land via event.
- The negative effects of bankruptcy now scale, with increasing penalties for every 250 gold you owe up to a maximum of 1000.
- It is no longer possible to create the Mongol/Timurid titles.
- Fixed numerous bugs with depose type CBs where wars would not end properly or revolters would become independent as a result of an abdication. As a part of these fixes, it will now take 1 day between the end of a successful depose war and the actual abdication of the loser.
- Oman now starts independent. I realize this is ahistorical, but equally ahistorical is the fact that it becomes the final holdout of the Seljuk Turks in most games, and I feel having it independent improves gameplay in the area.
- Cumans are now an Empire and Cherson is now in the Kingdom of Crimea. This was done to try and prevent Cumans from always ending up as a de jure title.
- Increased prestige gain for marrying into prestigious dynasties.
- Icelandic is now a separate culture.
- You can no longer fight De Jure wars against characters of a different religion group, to prevent them being used to get around the Holy War defensive chains.
- Reduced Holy Order cost back to 50 piety.
- Muslims can now only appoint a single concubine, as court sizes quickly get ridiculous with three of them.
- Added barony names, starting baronies and a reasonable number of barony slots to West Africa, so the area is now actually worth playing in. Many of the barony names have no historical grounds (named after modern settlements) so any input on name replacements from people knowledgeable of medieval West Africa would be welcome.
- Split Mauretania into the Kingdoms of Mauretania and Morocco.
- Integrated the All the Way to Timbuktu mod that adds 30 new provinces in West Africa, along with three new Kingdoms and a new Empire.
- Integrated Syren's Nicknames Mod with over 90 new ruler nicknames.
- Integrated Better Looking Characters mod. The parts that require the Mongol Faces DLC were placed in the optional module 'Mongol Faces'.
- The Papal State is now an Empire, both to prevent the Pope from being vassalized and to prevent the Papal State from assimiliating Spoleto.
- Removed the building cost reduction on oversee construction, but made it so the 'Meets Master Builder' event lowers the cost of all construction in the province by 20% for 10 years.
- Reduced the tax bonus from having your Steward collect taxes.
- Reduced the power of economic buildings. On average, a tax income building will pay itself back in 100 years.
- Pressing claims on behalf of claimaints now works as in vanilla, where a character will only become your landed vassal if they are your de jure vassal or of your dynasty.
- There are now three Muslim Titlar Kingdoms in Iberia: Al-Mawsat (Capital: Granada), Al-Xarq (Capital: Porto) and Al-Garb (Capital: Zaragoza). A ruler that holds all three can form the Titular Empire of Al-Andalus.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing Crusade/Jihad notifications from working properly.
- The AI must now spend some piety to call a Crusade or Jihad (preventing repeated failed Crusades by the same character).
- A ruler defending against a Crusade or Jihad can now call on a very large portion of their levies (players cannot do so if they are also fighting an offensive war).

1.06:
- Now compatible with 1.05d.
- Tweaked the Duchies in Syria and Mesopotamia.
- Mongol armies now vary from anywhere between 40k and 100k troops.
- Mongol titles are no longer 'landless', as this resulted in far too many little issues with succession and CBs. Instead, they will now seize a chunk of land around their starting province when they alive, and will be destroyed if their last county is taken. This should fix all the major bugs with Mongols not arriving, having weird successions, etc. As a side effect this also makes it possible to play as the Mongols.
- Properly implemented the 'gain a vassal title' plot.
- Increased chance of heresies appearing.
- Feudal taxation now goes from 5-25% instead of 0-40%, meaning that Feudal vassals are no longer completely tax exempt. This was done to add more of noticeable drawback for the player to be a vassal, since unlike vanilla your liege generally can't call on a significant portion of your troops.
- Slightly increased opinion malus for appointing a Castellan.
- If a Castellan revolts when you try to dismiss him, you will now gain claims on all his titles.
- You can now only appoint a single Castellan (reduced down from two).
- Castellans that are given King titles, numerous Duke titles or a large number of vassals are now more likely to revolt if you try to dismiss them.
- Rulers can now get claims on neighbouring titles via a random event.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing the cooldown on Crusades/Jihads from working correctly.
- Crusades targeting a De Jure Kingdom of an existing Emperor of the same religion will now grant the land to that Emperor (so a Crusade targeting Germany would give the land taken to the HRE).
- When winning lands in a Crusade, you will now get an event that allows you to set up a relative as an independent ruler of a Crusader state, though you may also choose to hold on to the land as before.
- Fixed a bug that caused the Regency trait to not be removed correctly.
- Reduced the frequency of spouses falling in love with each other (it was happening rather too often since the event could fire for either spouse).
- Upped the piety cost of players calling Crusades/Jihads to 500.
- Added a 20 year cooldown on the player calling Crusades/Jihads.

1.05:
- Fixed a major issue that was causing certain CBs not to work.
- The AI will no longer grant Duchies to characters of a different religion.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing Pagan bonus buildings from working.
- The King of Nubia in 1066 is now the correct culture.
- Calling a Crusade or Jihad now costs and requires 250 piety if the player is the one calling it.

1.04:
- Ported over all vanilla character history changes from 1.05.
- Added the decision to appoint up to two male, unlanded, non-primary heir characters as Castellans. Castellans are appointed governors of any titles you grant them, which can be retaken at any time with the 'Dismiss Castellan' decision, allowing you to use them as temporary governors of territory you cannot currently hold yourself, or wish to reserve for a relative in the future. The downside to Castellans is that they are much less efficient at ruling their territories, and will give you less 33% less tax and levies than an ordinary, landed vassal. Appointing Castellans will also slightly upset your hereditary vassals, who do not like the idea of appointed rulers. Muslims do not get Castellans since they have their own appointed ruler system. If a Castellan dies or inherits land, he immediately ceases to be a Castellan and his lands (not including any inheritance) returns to you.
- Empire-level titles will now inherit all laws properly from your primary title on creation.
- Investiture and Title crown laws are now tied to their De Jure Empire in the same way as crown authority.
- You can now press claims for female characters on titles with Cognatic succession. I tested allowing pressing claims on Agnatic-Cognatic but it made expansion far too easy by simply pressing claims for your wife.
- Increased piety cost of hiring Holy Orders.
- Holy Orders will now properly scale with time and religious authority.
- Reworked holy order troop composition to give some variety and also to prevent some holy orders from having an excess amount of certain troop types by end game.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing the 'rebel army rises up' event from firing.
- Heresies now scale better to authority, so you get a gradual decrease/increase of heresies as authority goes up/down rather than a few massive thresholds.
- Reduced the base chance of heresies appearing.
- Reduced the effect of head of religion diplomacy on religious authority. The default state of Catholicism should no longer be 100%.
- Highway Robber Bands, Thieves' Guilds and Smuggler Rings can now appear for rulers without an oversized demesne if their realm stats are low.
- Childbirth deaths will now show up correctly as a death cause.
- Fixed some issues with broken death localisations.
- Reduced province de jure integration time back to 100 years.
- Pagans can now create Scandinavia and all its Kingdom titles.
- Removed all title creation exceptions for non-AI players. Muslim players can no longer create France, etc.
- Dutch provinces can now build the squire list line of buildings. This is a placeholder until I can give them their own building series.
- Many more titular titles are now createable.
- AI characters with the right traits may now choose to hold to Rome despite the Pope's demands.
- Added a CB for Catholic rulers to return Rome to the Pope if another ruler takes it.
- The Pope will now only ask for Rome back once. You won't get the same request for future rulers unless he took it back inbetween.
- Fixed a reversed localisation when rulers join the enemy side in a war.
- Rolled all the Holy War/Religious Invasion CBs into a single Holy War CB with varying piety costs depending on distance and sanction. This was done because the AI did not recognize the new religious CBs and would not join in defensively.
- Reduced AI willingness to join Holy Wars and Crusades.
- Removed the intrigue requirement on starting plots, but made low-intrigue AI characters unlikely to use them.
- Eased up on opinion restrictions on murder plots, especially for characters with traits such as ambitious and cruel.
- Crusades can no longer be declared against heretics, as this resulted in some extremely absurd situations.
- Winning a crusade will no longer give you the Kingdom title, as this resulted in absurdities like an english Duke becoming the King of Germany because of a crusade declared against Mecklenburg.
- Long reign now starts at year 20 instead of year 10.
- Increased opinion malus for denying a vassal a title when they request it via event.
- Reduced the opinion malusus from desiring titles and Not De Jure Liege. Since civil wars are now much more dangerous, I feel that it is a good idea to reduce their frequency a bit, especially to make the AI a more challenging opponent. The effects of these may be raised again if it makes the world too stable.
- The regency triggered modifier is now a trait, that only affects vassal opinion instead of general opinion.
- When a vassal revolts to depose their liege (either via one of the three depose CBs or through a succession crisis), all other vassals will now get an event where they can choose whether or not to join in the revolt. The chance to join depends on traits, relations and dynastic relationships. This should make it significantly more dangerous to provoke your vassals into revolting, since even a small revolt can spiral out of control.
- Tweaked crusade weight chances to cut down on crusades against Sicily and the Wends.
- Added the createable titular kingdom of Aquitaine. Aquitaine can only be created by Occitains that control Bordeaux, and since it is a King-level title you must be independent or the vassal of an Emperor to create it.
- Removed Republic bonus buildings.
- Removed Papal bonus buildings.
- Reduced the power of Pagan bonus buildings.
- Added 1.05's Kingdom/Empire De Jure CBs as an experiment to see whether it has the negative effects on balance that I feared.
- Fixed a bug that was causing friends not to work correctly.
- Disabled the wrong religion occupation penalty, as I feel Holy Wars have been slowed down / made difficult enough that it is not necessary.
- Reduced warscore from battles.
- Fixed some bugs where the 'Win a War' ambition would not complete correctly.
- Fixed a bug with asking for a Sanctioned Holy War where nothing would happen when you took the decision.
- Removed the optional heraldry module until a version can be made that works with the 1.05c patch.
- Fixed a bug where Crusader/Mujahid would not be properly assigned to characters.
- Split up or tweaked many of the largest duchies to make duchy sizes more consistent between different regions.

1.03:
- Added crusade weighting for Kingdoms, so crusades/jihads are not totally random.
- Muslims now have their own Mujahid trait instead of getting the Crusader trait.
- Emperors can no longer create King titles they are the De Jure liege of (to prevent some very ahistorical title creation).
- The character designer will now work properly with CK2+ (ie you can no longer start as a pregnant, beheaded man).
- Reduced the power of republic levy building and made it cost money to build in holdings that do not start with it.
- Made the special republic CB cost prestige to slow down their blobbing.
- Added new CoA patterns from 1.05 to Heraldry mod.
- Fixed a bug that was causing the game to crash if you tried to start after 1204.
- Characters can now plot to assassinate rivals.
- Rügen is now a de jure part of Pomerania.
- Now uses vanilla death reasons instead of death causes mod.

1.02:
- Now compatible with 1.05c. Certain things (like the Kingdom/Empire de jure CBs) were not ported because I feel they break gameplay balance.
- Reduced supply limits experimentally, to see how the improved military AI works out.
- Tribal Invasion CB now targets Kingdoms instead of Duchies.
- Upped De Jure assimilation rate to 200 years.
- Titular Kingdoms (such as the Wends) are now created through 1.05's create titular title mechanic instead of via decision.
- Reduced revolt risk from distance.
- Removed the civil war modifier for now, to see how the new +revolt risk from independence revolts works out. Regency modifier is still in place.
- Removed the war of independence winning all wars of independence mechanic, since new ticking warscore makes it redundant.
- Tweaked the way traits affect piety. All virtues will now give at least a small amount of monthly piety, while all sins will give at least a small malus. The effects of traits such as humble, chaste and lustful that already affected piety were tweaked down to compensate.
- A player that is holding a 'landless' title (such as a mercenary company or a holy order) will now receive a one-time warning that doing so can cause severe bugs with the game.
- Fixed a bug where Kingdom-level titles would sometimes not be grantable to your vassals.
- Rulers whose religion has a religious head can now request sanction for a Holy War or Religious Invasion at a small prestige cost. If granted, it will allow them to wage a Sanctioned Holy War/Religious Invasion that has no piety cost and will give you some piety if you win it. The chance of sanction being granted depends on your piety and head of religion's opinion of you. Requesting sanction can only be done once every five years.
- The AI will now be less keen on doling out its entire demesne to its sons.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing the 'ruler goes native' event from firing.
- Fixed a bug that was causing you to get tyranny when a prisoner died in house arrest.
- Muslims can now get the Crusader trait for participating in Jihads. I will likely make a separate Jihadist trait at some point in the future.
- Temple holdings now give the province they're built in a 10% research boost, even if they don't have any research buildings built.
- You can no longer reorganize flanks. Until Paradox fixes the inherent balance issues with flanks the only real use for this is for player-only exploits.
- Reduced the size of the Norman, English and Norwegian armies in the Stamford Bridge scenario. While the armies are now smaller than they were historically, they are no longer confusingly out of sync with the actual army sizes in the rest of the mod.
- CK2Plus now features full French localisation.
- When taking or extending a loan you will now get a character modifier showing you when the loan is due.
- Restored the family trees that were broken to prevent certain claims from existing. Instead, those claims will be removed by a startup event that fires shortly after game start.
- You must no longer have the prestige on hand to fabricate claims, but you cannot fabricate claims if your prestige is below 0.
- The final level of Heavy Armor is now actually an upgrade.
- Titles created by decision will now inherit the succession law of your primary title (no more forming Empires with Gavelkind).
- You can no longer grant independence to De Jure vassals, to prevent certain exploits with De Jure CBs.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing the AI from abandoning certain failed plots and objectives.
- Renamed 'Get a Lover' to 'Fall in Love' to make it more appropriate for when the ambition is completed by falling in love with your spouse.
- Fixed a bug where 'Get a Lover' would abort if the character is chaste.
- Replaced the Pagan bonus buildings with culture buildings, so that foreign conquerors do not get the benefit of them.

1.01:
- CK2Plus now features full German localisation support.
- Contagious diseases are now rarer but more deadly.
- Changed scale of morale break threshold from 25-50% to 10-50% so martial skill is even more decisive.
- Added two new merc fleets, one in the black sea and the other near the holy land.
- Added five additional 500 man merc groups, non-hireable by the AI (located in: baltic, germany, balkans, egypt, arabia).
- Holy Wars will no longer result in gaining the target Duchy title, as it has proved impossible to fix the bugs and weird vassals gained from doing so.
- AI characters can now a pick a 'cooldown' ambition that is meant to reduce the frequency of murder plots occuring simply because they have nothing else to do.
- Added new ambitions: Convert a Province, Win a War, Gain Honorary Title, Adopt a Lifestyle, Gain a Kingdom and Become Emperor.
- Characters must now have at least 5 intrigue to start a plot.
- Religious conversion chance is now increased by having a large demesne.
- You must now be independent to grant a vassal independence.
- Granting independence to a De Jure vassal now costs 100 prestige, compared to 25 for releasing a not De Jure vassal.
- It no longer costs piety to imprison, exile or execute characters. While I think the piety costs make sense, it's rather strange that the actions are impossible to carry out if your piety is negative - why would low piety stop a cynical, depraved character from killing anyone?
- You can now declare war on characters that are either plotting to kill your close relatives or sheltering characters plotting to kill your close relatives in their realm. A victory will imprison all such plotters in your dungeon.
- Legitimizing Bastards is now done under Character Decisions.
- You can now declare Religious Defense on a ruler whose vassals are fighting some form of Holy War.
- Winning a Religious Defense war will now also end all variants of offensive Holy Wars their vassals are fighting against characters of your religion.
- The AI will no longer fight third-party claim wars where the claimaint would not end up as their vassal.
- The third-party claim war tooltip will now show you whether the claimaint will end up becoming your vassal after the peace or not.
- You can no longer declare third-party claim wars on a character that you already installed in a title via another third-party claim war. This is to prevent players from repeatedly invading the same County for prestige..
- Provinces with a revolt in progress should now show up as deep red on the revolt risk map.
- Gender succession laws can now only be changed one 'step' at a time (so you can't change from Agnatic to Cognatic or vice-versa, you have to first make it Agnatic-Cognatic).
- Revoking a title now always costs 100 prestige (to prevent a Muslim ruler from going completely nuts with revocations).
- Muslim rulers can now appoint up to 3 concubines from unmarried women in their court. Concubines will have legitimate children with their liege. If a concubine gets married or moves to a different court, she ceases to be a concubine.
- Muslim vassals can now plot to institute hereditary titles.
- Muslim rulers now have a new crown law category: Titles. This crown law determines whether titles can be freely revoked (without relation hits to other vassals), representing the Muslim system of appointed rather than hereditary rulers. Having the free revocation law in effect will make your vassals like you less, and they can still refuse and revolt when you try to revoke their titles. 
- Reworked the Award Honorary Title diplomatic action into a Character Decisions menu that contains both honorary titles and new character decisions.
- Added the 'Grant Independence' character decision that allows you to set a vassal free at the cost of a relations and prestige hit.
- Added the 'Revoke Honorary Title' character decision that allows you to revoke an honorary title. This will cause a relations hit unless the title you were revoking was that of Court Jester.
- Tweaked Papal name list to contain mostly names that were actually used during the CK2 era.
- Restored the Almoravid claims but made them an Emirate instead of a Sultanate in 1066, to give other Muslim rulers in the area a fighting chance.
- Split the Duchy of Marrakech into the Duchies of Marrakech and Ifni.
- Fixed some bugs with holy orders.
- Scaled Amass Wealth and Become Exalted Among Men ambitions to your title rank, to make them more feasible to achieve for a Count and more difficult to achieve for a King or Emperor.
- Reduced frequency of non immediate family (sibling or child) relatives asking you for titles.
- Relatives who are offended by your refusal to give them a title may now plot to force the issue.
- Relatives who ask for titles will now usually be offended if you deny them. If you have decent diplomacy you may be able avoid offending them.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing the AI from executing assassination plots.
- The AI will now abandon objectives after ten years of failing to fulfill them.
- Prestigious vassals can now plot to acquire their liege's primary title, even if they do not have a claim on it.
- Vassals can now plot against a liege that is not their top liege, making it more dangerous for a vassal lord to anger their own vassals.
- Fixed a bug with Arrange Courtier Marriages where it would spawn multiple women with the same name.
- Rebalanced the effects of levy laws. They will provide less minimum levies, but have less of an impact on relations as well.
- There are now five levels of each tax and levy law instead of four. This means that realms with an active crown law will always be able to have higher law settings than one completely without.
- Fixed a persistent bug where children would always be stillborn if their mother died in childbirth.
- Reduced the overall frequency of genetics traits when not inherited from parents (so you'll have less dwarven hunchback debutantes showing up at court).
- Decreased chance of inheriting Quick, Genius, Slow and Imbecile.
- Increased chance of inheriting Tall.
- Fabricating claims now has a fixed gold cost equal to the prestige cost. However, unlike prestige you do not need to have the gold on hand.
- Reduced the number of heavy cavalry gained from the German/Frankish culture buildings.

1.00:
- It is now possible to sail between the Nile Delta and the Gulf of Suez. This is necessary because otherwise the AI has issues with getting its troops stuck waiting for ships on the other side.
- Added decisions to form special titular Kingdoms for Muslims in Iberia.
- Reduced piety gain from handing titles to church, so that it is not possible to wage perpetual Holy War simply by handing out the temples you gain.
- A white peace in an independence war will no longer result in independence.
- Winning an independence war will now result in all other independence wars against the same target being automatically won. Ideally I would have liked to make independence war a war where you can call in other vassals who also become independent if you win, but this does not seem to be possible to do.
- Winning a war to replace your liege (by any of the various CBs) will now end any wars with the same general goal inconclusively.
- Winning a Religious Defense war will now end any offensive Crusade or Religious Wars the enemy is fighting against your religion. Any other Religious Defense wars your faith is waging against the same target will also end inconclusively.
- It is now possible to wage Holy War against distant enemies. Such a war is distinguished by a different name: Religious Invasion. A Religious Invasion costs 250 piety and cannot be declared if your piety is below 0.
- It now costs 100 piety to wage a Holy War on a neighbouring enemy. You cannot declare a Holy War if your piety is below 0. This is meant to represent Church/Temple approval of your war, and also to slow down the general pace of expansion.
- Changed the way invasions work. Instead of taking all occupied titles, you now get all titles the target character was holding which fall under the Kingdom you were invading. So if William wins the Norman Invasion, he takes the Kingdom of England and all English Counties, Duchies and Baronies Harold was holding.
- Pagans can now wage Holy Wars.
- Made the AI more reluctant to expand into Ethiopia.
- Axum is once again independent at game start.
- Added preferred terrain types for different unit/tactics. For instance, Pikemen will perform better in hills and mountains but poorly in forests, while light cavalry will do well in forests and deserts but poorly in mountains.
- Changed all battle tactic stats into standardized formulas.
- Linked battle morale break point with generals martial stat (flanks with no general will break at 50% morale, decreasing in increments to 25% break point at 20+ martial skill).
- Added mild defensive bonuses to most terrain types.
- Added the Have Fifteen Children and Have Twenty Children ambitions. Completing the Have Twenty Children ambition will give you a special nickname.
- Orthodox Priests can now marry.
- AI Barons will now get married instead of letting their dynasties die out.
- Feasts, Grand Hunts and Summer Fairs now cost a fixed amount of money depending on your title rank. Many of the events related to them have also been given fixed gold costs.
- Titular titles can no longer have Elective succession (as they have no valid electors).
- You now have a small chance of fabricating claims on a Duchy, even if your Chancellor has < 15 skill.
- Your chance of successfully fabricating a claim is now increased by having high prestige.
- Increased the prestige cost of fabricating claims to 200/500 for County/Duchy.
- Increased the wrong holding type penalty to -66%.
- Reduced the effects of ambitious and content to -30/+30 respectively.
- Added a decision to automatically arrange marriages for all eligible bachelors in your court. The characters will primarily marry women in your court, but if there is not enough women then random spouses will be generated for them. This decision is meant for people like me who like to have a large court but don't want to go through the tedious micromanagement of finding spouses for every male courtier. Close relatives of yours will not be affected by this decision, so you won't accidentally marry your son or daughter to a courtier.
- Switching out of Elective now requires High Crown Authority.
- Localisation should no longer be a mess in non-default language settings, though all the text from the mod will be in English.
- Tweaked province names, laws and borders in Poland.
- Integrated the 'Offer You Can't Refuse' mod that adds Sicilian cultural melting pots.
- Characters now have a 5% chance of gaining the culture of their province shortly after birth.
- Rulers can now 'go native', converting them and any children of theirs below the age of 16 to the culture of their capital province. Kings and Emperors are much less likely to go native. The chance to go native goes down with age. The player gets an option to avoid it happening to their character.
- Removed Warrior Cults. Instead, Pagans start with more regular troop buildings.
- East Africa, Sicily and Christian Iberia now start with more troop buildings.
- Removed the direct warscore bonus for holding contested settlements.
- Doubled the yearly warscore bonus for holding contested settlements.
- Tweaked it so that Barons can't convert the culture of a province. This should slow down rate of culture conversion.
- Reduced truce time for Ducal Claim wars to 6 years.
- Reduced truce time for County Claim wars to 3 years.
- The ruler of Mallorca in 1066 is now much more historical.
- Religious Head and Holy Order titles will now automatically convert characters holding them to their religion.
- Rebalanced province values in Russia and Scandinavia. Overall development potential of provinces was reduced.
- You will no longer have vassals declare independence wars without warning. Instead, vassal revolt risk and effects of regencies/civil wars were tweaked so that revolt chain reactions should happen on their own (see below).
- Added a decision to become King of Wends if you are Wend Pagan ruler that holds the Duchies of Brandenburg, Mecklenburg, Pommerania or Pomeralia either directly or through vassals.
- The AI will now make proper use of demesne laws.
- Tax laws are now tied to crown authority in the same way as Levy laws. Default tax laws are None for Feudal vassals and Minimum for Church and City vassals. This should put large Duchies at more of a disadvantage to proper Kingdoms.
- Added the county of Teate in Benevento to make the borders between Sicily and Lombardy more historical.
- Fixed some bugs related to heresies.
- You will no longer get tyranny from characters dying in your prison unless they died as a result of illnesses contracted from being in prison.
- Sick or injured prisoners will now ask for better accomondations, even if they were previously denied them. This is meant to give the player a second chance to avoid a tyranny hit if a prisoner falls ill.
- The dungeon and the oubliette no longer give direct health maluses, instead they make it much more likely to catch an illness.
- Rebalanced the Mongols to have fewer but larger stacks.
- Reduced the effects of dynastic prestige on marriages and newly born characters (having babies born with 500 prestige was getting silly).
- Winning a Holy War or Crusade will now result in taking the Duchy title the war was for, if the enemy is holding it. You still get all the holdings in the Duchy.
- Created an event will make the AI much smarter about handing out newly created Duchy titles, preferring to give them to Counts with their capital in the right area, or alternatively granting them along with a County to a Courtier, only granting a Duke title to an existing Duke if there are no better alternatives. This will only sometimes work on revoked/usurped titles, as the AI is sometimes too fast for my handout event to take effect.
- The Duchy of Tyrol is no longer divided by impassable mountains.
- Tweaked some weirdly shaped provinces.
- Tweaked Duchy borders in Algiers, and added the Duchy of Atlas.
- Added Ibiza as a County in the Duchy of Mallorca.
- Added the Kingdom of Azerbaijan as a de jure part of the Empire of Persia, composed of the Duchies of Tabriz, Azerbaijan and Derbent.
- Pommerania is now de jure a part of Germany.
- Salzburg is now a de jure part of Austria.
- Grisons is now a de jure part of Tyrol.
- Viviers is now a de jure part of Auvergne.
- Anhalt is now a de jure part of Brandenburg.
- Fejer is now a de jure part of Esztergom.
- Vendome is now a de jure part of Anjou.
- Damman and Basra are now de jure parts of Arabia.
- Jacwiez and Yatvagi are now de jure part of Lithuania.
- Rebellions will now rarely result in a large rebel army rising up. If the rebels take control of a province, the chance of bad rebel events (like burned buildings or killed province lords) increases, and the province may defect.
- Integrated 'culturally different cities' mod which gives different culture groups their own distinct city graphics.
- Rebalanced culture buildings so that different culture groups are roughly on part with each other.
- Cost of tech growth buildings is now consistent at 200 gold per 10% growth speed the building confers.
- Khazars now start with 2 provinces, and Itil was split into the Duchies of Itil and Saray so that nobody will have a ducal claim on them. This should give them a chance of surviving past the first five minutes of the game.
- Reduced the relations penalty for title claimaints.
- Stressed and Depressed are now mutually exclusive.
- When a character with the dishonorable trait dies, their heir will now get a 'dynastic stain' trait that confers diplomatic penalties equal to their predecessor's level of dishonorable, but which does not qualify you for excommunication or other ill effects of being dishonorable. If a character with dynastic stain is caught assassinating, the dynastic stain turns into a regular dishonorable trait at one level above what their dynastic stain level was at. Assuming you keep dynastic stain from being turned into dishonorable, it will not be transferred over to your heir. This change is meant to  add additional risk to inheritance-by-assassination, as you can now not simply wash away the consequenses by dying.
